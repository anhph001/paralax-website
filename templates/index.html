        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effect Demonstration</h2>
        <p>
            Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object because of a change in the observer's point of view.
            Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex
            cameras that view objects from slightly different angles.
            Many animals, along with humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax
            to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis.
            In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a
            device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some variations also
            altitude to a target. <br><br>
